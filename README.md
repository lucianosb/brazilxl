SDXL LoRAs on Brazilian Culture

[Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lucianosb/brazilxl-demo) | [All Models](https://huggingface.co/collections/lucianosb/brazil-xl-66a0d5c784cb271417ad3568) | [PyData presentation](https://www.youtube.com/live/TBgdYjGPpO4?si=OzjjqKJJ2S2MwPd6) | [Slides](https://lucianosb.github.io/brazilxl/)

Brazil XL is an initiative that brings better representations of Brazilian culture to Stable Diffusion. I started this when I noticed some keywords would not generate the desired subject on any base model, so I trained my own models and I'm sharing them with the open-source community.

This repository is a mirror from the original HF Space.

## Installation

I recommend using it in a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the demo with

```bash
python app.py
```
